## About

>  Responsibility and respectful attitude to my work is an indispensable part of me. Lifelong learning and self-development are crucial for me. I am interested in web dev & computer graphics. I gained some experience of working in this area with small individual projects. As this area supplement my studies at RS-School, I keep on gaining more experience in the field.  


>  For this reason, I am looking for a company willing to offer me interesting projects and time to learn job technologies. I would offer my full commitment, and be a pleasant and friendly addition to your team. I am therefore currently looking for a job or an internship as a front- end developer.
